# Hi there, I'm **Vikesh Ajith** (*SpikyClip*)
I am a full-stack bioinformatics data engineer with 3+ years of
experience working at the intersection of data engineering and biology.
I bring value to scientists by managing and processing their large
streams of data to deliver tidy, accessible datasets that allow them to
spend less time wrangling data and more time discovering biological
insights. I currently work for the [Next-Generation Precision
Medicine Program
(NGPMP)](https://www.hudson.org.au/research-program/vpcc-next-generation-precision-medicine/)
at the Hudson Institute's Centre for Cancer Research (CCR).

Fewer than 1 in 5 children with cancer are found to have actionable mutations
that are targetable with existing drug therapies. To improve these odds, our
program has developed an extensive collection of paediatric cancer cell line
models which then undergo a comprehensive set of functional genomic screens to
identify novel drivers of low-survival paediatric cancers. High-thoroughput drug
screens are then used to identify potential treatments that precisely target
these novel mutations. Published data is then made available through the
[Childhood Cancer Model Atlas
(CCMA)]([https://lookerstudio.google.com/u/1/reporting/933d232a-b8dd-4801-8fe5-5e9214d2722b/page/p_9i9wsspiad](https://hudson.org.au/ccma/)).

Our program produces terabytes of data that has to be stored, processed,
cleaned, and annotated before being disseminated to researchers for downstream
analysis. My role as a data engineer is to effectively manage the above data
lifecycle so that researchers can spend more time on analysis and less time on
data wrangling.

I am well versed in bioinformatics, which is a requirement in order
to effectively and accurately process a broad variety of genomic data.
Apart from my love of data engineering, I am also passionate about using
statistics and effective data visualisation to make data-driven
decisions. My other hobbies include:

- 🪓 **Woodworking** (i.e. collecting tools that I may someday use)
- 🕹️ **Gaming** (the more byzantine, the better e.g. Dwarf Fortress, Factorio)
- 📷 **Photography** (I was particularly prolific when I studied agriculture,
and there were plenty of canola fields...)
